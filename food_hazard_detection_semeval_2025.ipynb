    "*– Norman Borlaug*, the Nobel Price Winner for his role on the Development of Agriculture (Green Revolution), who showed the world that the fight for safe food is a fight for life.\n",
    "\n",
    "* His words apply for all and especially for those harmed by unsafe food (Poor Food Safety) or the absence of food altogether (Poor Food Security).\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is society's responsibility to ensure that everyone has access to safe and reliable nourishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this assignment we will talk specifically about unsafe food.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Food Safety** is the process of \"handling, preparing, and storing food in ways that prevent foodborne illness (also known as food poisoning)\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety)).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Another useful term is **Food Hazard** which is \"the biological, chemical or physical agent in a food that has potential to cause health effects\" and which deems a food item as unsafe for consumption ([Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/food-safety-hazard)).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unfortunately, there have been countless instances where food has been recalled due to inadequate safety regulations or rushed distribution without adequate test driven by profit over safety.\n",
    "\n",
    "* According to World Health Organization (WHO) Newsroom page (2024, found [here](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/food-safety)):\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Contaminated food affects $600$ million people annually, leading to $420.000$ deaths globally, with children under 5 years old bearing a disproportionate burden, accounting for 125,000 deaths annually due to foodborne diseases.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    * Unsafe food costs $110$$ billion annually in productivity losses and medical expenses.\n",
    " \n",
    "* Food safety is a serious issue that needs strong efforts to address and solve. Leveraging technology in this context can help find even better solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This assignment is part of the **SemEval 2025 Task 9: The Food Hazard Detection Challenge** held by **EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)**, which sets the challenge: how can machine learning be used for food hazard detection in recalls.\n",

    " | Model      | Year | Developed By | Characteristics |\n",
    "|-----------|------|-------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **BERT** (*Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers*) | 2018 | Google AI | - Bidirectional context (words before and after target word)|\n",
    "| **RoBERTa** (*Robustly Optimized BERT*) | 2019 | Facebook AI | - Better focus on 1 sentence tasks <br>- Trained on more data than BERT for longer <br> - More robust and accurate than BERT generaly|\n",
    "| **DistilBERT** (*Distilled BERT*) | 2019 | Hugging Face | - fewer parameters than BERT<br>- 95% of BERT's performance with lower computational cost\n",
    "| **DeBERTa** (*Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention*) | 2020 | Microsoft AI | - More advanced context representation than BERT/RoBERTa <br>- computationally heavy model with a lot of parameters| \n",
    "\n",
    "* As for DistilBERT, we won't be using it since our primary goal is F1-Score and not cost-efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As for the others, based on the study *\"BERT, RoBERTa or DeBERTa? Comparing Performance Across Transformers Models in Political Science Text\"* by *Joan C. Timoneda and Sebastián Vallejo Vera*, published in The *Journal of Politics*, which examines the effectiveness of various transformer models in political science applications, it was found that **RoBERTa and DeBERTa often outperform BERT in specific scenarios**, particularly when fine-tuned for specialized texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* So we are between RoBERTa and DeBERTa.\n",
    "\n",
    "* DeBERTa generally outperforms RoBERTa in the bibliography, but its size and complex mechanisms might overfit our data since they are not that many (close to $6.000$ rows with the subtask 1 augmentation) of text on average composed of $20$ words.\n",
    "\n",
    "* So **let's try RoBERTa** which seems to be the most promicing using clean-text to predict `hazard-category` and `title` to predict `product-category` as we did in Logistic Regression. However, it is important to emphasize that **<ins>TRIAL AND ERROR WAS UTILIZED and the code below was rerun for all models with RoBERTa performing highest, DeBERTa extremelly low and BERT and DistilBERT at medium values close to RoBERTa.</ins>**\n",

    "        * ex. ['listeria', 'allergy'] -> [0,1].\n",
    "        \n",
    "        * For this we use `LabelEncoder()` the tool that does excactly that.\n",
    "    3) The text data (text and title):\n",
    "    \n",
    "       * ex. Suppose our \"clean-text\" is: \"Listeria contamination can occur in refrigerated foods.\"\n",
    "        \n",
    "       * The tokenizer converts this into:\n",
